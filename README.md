Step 1: Create an API key for Youtube.

Step 2: Create a Repository and push it to GitLab.

Step 3: Launch an Ec2 instance and run Sonarqube on it.

Step 4A: Create a .gitlab-ci.yml File.

Step 4B: Add the required variables for the project.

Step 5: Install Gitlab Runner on Ec2.

Step 6: Run the Application on the Docker container.

Step 7: Access the Application on Browser.

Step 1: Create an API key from Rapid API
Open a new tab in the browser and search for rapidapi.com

It will automatically provide your mail and select a mail to create an account



Account is created



Now in the search bar search for YouTube and select YouTube v3



Copy API and save it for further use at the docker stage.

docker build --build-arg REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY=<API-KEY> -t ${imageName} .



Second way:

Open a new tab in the browser and search for rapidapi.com

You will see the page like this and click on signUp



Now click on Sign Up with Google



Select your mail here



It will automatically create your account now



Now in the search bar search for YouTube and select YouTube v3



Copy API and save it for further use at the docker stage.

docker build --build-arg REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY=<API-KEY> -t ${imageName} .



Step 2: Create a Repository and push it to GitLab
Go to GitLab.com and login to your account

Click on New Project



Click on Create Blank Project



Provide a name for the Project

Keep Visibility to the public

Uncheck the Readme and create the Project.



Use the below commands to push code to GitLab



Files pushed to GitLab



Step 3: Launch an Ec2 instance and run Sonarqube on it
Log into AWS Console: Sign in to your AWS account.

Launch an Instance:

Choose "EC2" from services. Click "Launch Instance."

Choose an AMI: Select an Ubuntu image.

Choose an Instance Type: Pick "t2.medium."

Key Pair: Choose an existing key pair or create a new one.

Configure Security Group:

Create a new security group. Add rules for HTTP, and HTTPS, and open all ports for learning purposes. Add Storage: Allocate at least 10 GB of storage.

Launch Instance: Review and launch the instance.

Access Your Instance: Use SSH to connect to your instance with the private key.

Keep in mind, that opening all ports is not recommended for production environments; it's just for educational purposes.



Connect to Your EC2 Instance and install docker:

Run the below commands to install the docker


COPY
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER   #my case is ubuntu
newgrp docker
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
After the docker installation, we will create a Sonarqube container (Remember to add 9000 ports in the security group).

Run this command on your EC2 instance to create a SonarQube container:


COPY
docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community


Now copy the IP address of the ec2 instance


COPY
<ec2-public-ip:9000>


Enter username and password, click on login and change password


COPY
username admin
password admin


Update New password, This is Sonar Dashboard.



Step 4A: Create a .gitlab-ci.yml File.
Now go to GitLab click on '+' and click on Newfile



File name .gitlab-ci.yml

    script:
        - npm install


Commit the changes and it will automatically start the build

Now click on Build and Pipelines



Now click on Running.



Click on Install dependency



You will build output



Now add the Sonarqube stage to the pipeline

Go to the Sonarqube dashboard and click on Manually.



Provide the name of the Project and click on Setup



Select the CI tool as GitLab CI



Select Other because we are using the JS App

It will provide code and we need to create a file inside our repo



Go to Gitlab and click on + and Newfile



Filename is sonar-project.properties

Paste the content that you got from Sonarqube



The file looks like this and click on commit changes



Go to Sonarqube and click on continue



Now it will provide Variables to add to our GitLab

Step 4B: Add the required variables for the project.
Variables Generated



Now go to GitLab

Click on settings and CI/CD



Click on Expand in variables



Click on Add variable



Now go back to Sonarqube and copy the Key

Click on Generate a token



Again Click on Generate



Copy the token



Now come back to GitLab and add them like the below image and click on add variable.



Sonar token is added



Now go to the Sonarqube Dashboard again

Let's add another variable, copy them



Now go to GitLab and click on Add variable



Add the copied values like the below image



Two variables were added.



Now go back to the Sonarqube Dashboard

Click on continue



It will provide and CI configuration file copy it and use it inside our .gitlab-ci.yml file
